		question: "What is The Introduction?",
		answer:
			"The Introduction is an AI-powered platform designed to help matchmakers connect their friends and family. We make it easy to keep track of your single friends, remember important details, and find great matches—all with the help of smart notes and intelligent suggestions.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does the AI help with matchmaking?",
		answer:
			"Our AI analyzes your notes about each person to identify compatibility factors, suggest potential matches, and help you remember key details. It's like having a personal assistant that never forgets a birthday, a hobby, or that someone is looking for a partner who loves hiking.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is my data private and secure?",
		answer:
			"Absolutely. Your notes and all personal information are encrypted and stored securely. We never share your data with third parties, and you maintain full control over who sees what. Privacy is a core value—we're here to help you connect people, not exploit their data.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use this if I'm not a professional matchmaker?",
		answer:
			"Yes! The Introduction is perfect for anyone who enjoys playing matchmaker—whether you're setting up friends, helping family members find love, or just love the thrill of making great connections. No professional experience required.",
	},
	{
		question: "How much does it cost?",
		answer:
			"We're currently in development and building our waitlist. Pricing details will be announced before launch, but we're committed to keeping it affordable and accessible for everyone who wants to spread a little love.",
	},
	{
		question: "When will The Introduction be available?",
		answer:
			"We're working hard to launch soon! Join our waitlist to be among the first to know when we go live. Waitlist members will get early access and exclusive benefits.",
	},
